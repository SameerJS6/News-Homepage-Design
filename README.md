## My process

- The first step was dividing the preview into sub-grid and then starting to construct HTML Layout. 
- The second step, was styling the HTML.
- And then, Once the styling was done, added a bit of Javascript to Function Mobile Navbar.
- Last Step for me was, Cleaning up the page a little bit.
- And That's it, It took me around 2-2.5 hours to finish this one.
- It was just a practice project.


### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup

Also learned about this Media Funcition of CSS, see below:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
      :root {
        --bg: #050412;
        --sidebar: #2F304C;
        --neutral-700: #B3B8EF;
        --svg: hsl(36, 100%, 99%);
        --hover: hsl(5, 85%, 73%);
        --accent: hsl(233, 8%, 79%);
        --primary-400: hsl(34, 84%, 57%);
        --read-hover: hsl(235, 99%, 92%);
        --neutral-900:  hsl(36, 100%, 99%);
    }
}

```


### What I learned

- Well, didn't learn something new but definitely improved in CSS Grid and Responsive Layouts.
- And Anyway it was a practicing Project.

### Continued development

- Will continue learning more about the grid and Responsive layout UI.
- Also, will use more of @Media (prefers-color-scheme).
